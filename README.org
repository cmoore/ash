* Ash

[[./ash.jpg]]


Ash is a Selenium client for Common Lisp.  It was written against the Selenium 2.x JSON wire protocol described [[https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html][here]].

It is *incomplete* - This was written for a separate project and I added functionality as I needed it.  Over time, however, it has proved to be quite useful.


* Examples

#+NAME: example1
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-session ()
  (page-open "http://google.com"))
#+END_SRC

Creates a new session, opens the page, and closes the session.

#+NAME: example2
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-session (:autoclose nil)
  (page-open "http://www.google.com"))
#+END_SRC

Creates a new session, opens the page, but does not close the session.

#+NAME: example3
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(with-a-session
  (page-click (find-element-by-text "Login")))
#+END_SRC

Uses the session from example2, and clicks on the first element with the text "Login".

Note that ~with-a-session~ will use the *first available session* with no regard to whether it is in use or not.  If you're using Selenium Grid, or using multiple connections to Selenium, you're almost always better off using ~with-session~.
